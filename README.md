# GitHub Horoscope: AI-Based Code Zodiac ‚ú®üîÆ

Welcome to **GitHub Horoscope**, an AI-powered app that assigns developers a "coding zodiac sign" based on their GitHub profile activity and generates playful horoscopes about their coding journey! Whether you're a **Bugittarius** who thrives under pressure or a **Refactoricorn** obsessed with clean code, this app will bring some fun to your daily coding routine.

## üéØ Features

  - Programming languages used
  - Number of commits and most active coding hours

- **Code Zodiac Sign Assignment:** Based on the analysis, the app assigns one of several funny "code zodiac signs" like **Bugittarius**, **Refactoricorn**, **Mergequarius**, or **Commitricorn**.

- **Funny Horoscope Generation:** The app uses the Gemini API to generate humorous horoscopes based on the user's coding habits.

- **Share and Compare:** Users can share their horoscopes or compare their "zodiac signs" with friends. The app even suggests "compatibility" with other developers based on their signs.
